I joined the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) on April 4th. Nearly 2 weeks are done at the time of writing this post, and yet I have already been thrown right into project work.

Our first project was called Project Benson. For the prompt of the project, an organization called WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is holding an annual gala at the beginning of the summer. We are being approached to help garner attendance at the gala while also making sure there are people passionate about increasing women participation in technology who would build awareness and reach for the cause.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
