I joined the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) on April 4th. Nearly 2 weeks are done at the time of writing this post, and yet I have already been thrown right into project work.

Our first project was called Project Benson. For the prompt of the project, an organization called WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is holding an annual gala at the beginning of the summer. We are being approached to help garner attendance at the gala while also making sure there are people passionate about increasing women participation in technology who would build awareness and reach for the cause. To get this done we must place street teams at the entrances of subway stations in New York City who will collect email addresses of those who show interest who will be sent free tickets to the gala.

In order to tackle this problem the main source of data my project group and I used was the MTA turnstile subway data. We looked at the data from the previous month of March for our analysis. There was a lot of useful data relevant to our endgame goal such as entries and exit counts for turnstiles at specific times on specific days at specific stations.
